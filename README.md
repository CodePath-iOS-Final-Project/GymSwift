## Overview
### Description

Our plan is to create an app for college students to hold them accountable so that they can stay on a healthy track and workout. We are going to do this by building an app to help them find a workout partner for a quick workout around the campus/neighborhood, so that they are held accountable. 

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Fitness/Social Networking
-  **Mobile:** The prototype would be for iOS and there would be no camera accessibility (Uses camera roll and uploads). Functionality would not be limited to iOS but it would eventually expand to Android and PC. 
- **Story:** Allows users to find a workout partner and have somebody to hold them accountable for a healthy lifestyle. Students can stick to workout plans because their "partner" will keep them in check. They can organize their fitness journey alongside others that share the same interests in fitness. 
- **Market:** Provides an exciting match-up experience for students from all diverse backgrounds and helps them stay in shape. Futhermore, students with tight budgets that can't really afford to join a gym will have an accountability buddy that will help them to stay motivated. 
- **Habit:** The app's habit-forming quality is that bonds are formed and users would feel as if they need to continually keep tabs on their partners. The accountability section would be easy to use and fun to navigate because of its sleek UI/UX. 
- **Scope:** College students that want to get back to working out and meeting new people, especially after COVID limited in-person contact. Ensure safety for women and utilize background checks to make sure that they are protected against those who have malintent. Over time, it could expand to working professionals who lost the will to stay in shape. Cross-platform functionality would be available in the future.
